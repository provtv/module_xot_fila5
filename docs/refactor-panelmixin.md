# Refactor: Panel Mixin Extension Pattern

Eliminated static `PanelModuleResolver` utility and refactored `GetPanelsNavigationItems` to use `PanelMixin` methods directly. This aligns the codebase with OOP principles and maintains a single source of truth for panel metadata.

## Changes

### Updated GetPanelsNavigationItems

**File**: `app/Actions/Filament/GetPanelsNavigationItems.php`

- Removed import of `PanelModuleResolver`
- Replaced static calls with mixin methods:
  - `PanelModuleResolver::navigationIcon($panel)` → `$panel->getNavigationIcon()`
  - `PanelModuleResolver::navigationLabel($panel)` → `$panel->getNavigationLabel()`
  - `PanelModuleResolver::navigationSort($panel)` → `$panel->getNavigationSort()`

### Removed Unused Resolver

**File**: `app/Support/PanelModuleResolver.php` (DELETED)

- Contained duplicate logic already in `PanelMixin`
- No usages found in codebase
- All methods now available via mixin

### Documentation Added

- `panel-mixin-extension-pattern.md` — Complete pattern guide
- `refactor-panelmixin.md` — This refactoring summary
- Updated `INDEX.md` with "Extension Patterns" section

## Rationale

1. **Single Source of Truth** — Mixin is the only place panel metadata logic lives
2. **OOP Principles** — Methods belong to the object instance, not static utilities
3. **Discoverability** — IDE autocomplete shows available panel methods
4. **Maintainability** — Reduced code duplication, fewer files to maintain

## Testing & Verification

- ✅ Grep: Verified no other usages of `PanelModuleResolver`
- ✅ Syntax: Code verified as correct
- ✅ Quality: PHPMD, PHPStan checks performed
- ✅ Documentation: Comprehensive guide created and integrated

# Context Compression and Retrieval

> Xot-facing summary of the shared context-compression setup.

## Main Signals

- project-shared MCP config now includes `token-optimizer`
- the optimizer is installed locally under `bashscripts/mcp/`
- QMD remains the first retrieval layer for docs/wiki, while token optimization reduces repeated or bulky tool context
- official Kilo guidance confirms that large projects should keep `AGENTS.md` concise, MCP minimal, and noisy folders excluded with `.kilocodeignore` plus `watcher.ignore`
- repository policy keeps managed indexing disabled until the team intentionally selects a local or cloud indexing path
- local indexing prerequisites now exist in-repo as Ollama `nomic-embed-text` plus local Qdrant, so Xot can later opt into indexing without new system setup
- final activation of Kilo indexing is still treated as a client-side confirmation step, not yet as a pure repo config contract
- OpenCode now has a repository-level `opencode.json` at the git root with explicit compaction (`auto`, `prune`, `reserved=40000`)
- global OpenCode config also loads `@tarquinen/opencode-dcp@latest`, so long Xot sessions have an extra pruning layer before provider overflow

## Why Xot Cares

Xot raw docs are among the largest in the repository. The recommended path is:

1. query Xot wiki first
2. open only the specific raw cluster needed
3. rely on token optimization for repeated tooling output
4. if using Kilo/OpenCode, compact between major topic shifts instead of carrying one giant session through unrelated Xot areas
5. prefer wiki/QMD retrieval over full raw Xot doc dumps even after the DCP fix; compression helps, but DRY retrieval is still the first control

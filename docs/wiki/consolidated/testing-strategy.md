# Testing Strategy: MySQL-Based Testing Without RefreshDatabase

## Overview

This document outlines our testing strategy that uses MySQL as the test database without utilizing Laravel's `RefreshDatabase` trait. This approach was chosen after careful consideration of our specific testing needs and project requirements.

## Current Implementation

- **Database**: MySQL (configured in `.env.testing`)
- **Test Isolation**: Manual data management instead of database transactions
- **Test Data**: Real data persists between tests
- **Test Speed**: Slower than in-memory SQLite but more reliable

## Configuration

`.env.testing` contains:

```ini
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=test_database
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

## Advantages (80% Positive Impact)

1. **Real-World Fidelity (25%)**
   - Tests run against the same database engine as production
   - Uncovers database-specific issues early
   - More accurate performance characteristics

2. **Simpler Test Setup (20%)**
   - No need to manage database transactions
   - Easier to debug with persistent data
   - Simpler test data management

3. **Better for Complex Features (20%)**
   - Handles complex queries and relationships better
   - More reliable for testing database constraints
   - Better for testing database migrations

4. **Developer Experience (15%)**
   - Easier to inspect test data after test runs
   - Can use database clients to debug test failures
   - Consistent behavior with development and production

## Disadvantages (20% Negative Impact)

1. **Slower Test Execution (40%)**
   - MySQL is slower than SQLite for test execution
   - No automatic transaction rollback between tests
   - Requires manual cleanup

2. **Test Pollution Risk (30%)**
   - Tests can affect each other if not properly isolated
   - Requires careful management of test data
   - Potential for false positives/negatives if data persists

3. **Maintenance Overhead (20%)**
   - Need to manage database state manually
   - More complex CI/CD pipeline requirements
   - Larger test database to maintain

4. **Resource Intensive (10%)**
   - Requires a running MySQL instance
   - Higher memory and CPU usage
   - Slower feedback loop during development

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Data Management

```php
// Instead of using RefreshDatabase trait, use:
protected function setUp(): void
{
    parent::setUp();
    // Clear only necessary data before each test
    DB::table('users')->truncate();
}
```

### 2. Test Isolation

```php
test('user can login', function () {
    // Arrange
    $user = User::factory()->create();

    // Act & Assert
    $this->post('/login', [
        'email' => $user->email,
        'password' => 'password'
    ])->assertRedirect('/dashboard');

    // Cleanup (if needed)
    $user->forceDelete();
});
```

### 3. Database Cleanup

Create a `DatabaseCleanup` trait:

```php
trait DatabaseCleanup
{
    protected function cleanDatabase()
    {
        // List tables to clean (in correct order to respect foreign keys)
        $tables = [
            'sessions',
            'password_reset_tokens',
            'users',
            // Add other tables as needed
        ];

        foreach ($tables as $table) {
            DB::table($table)->truncate();
        }
    }
}
```

## Migration Strategy

1. **Test Database Migrations**
   - Run migrations before test suite starts
   - Consider using a separate database for testing
   - Reset database state between test runs

2. **Test Data Factories**
   - Use factories to create test data
   - Ensure factories clean up after themselves
   - Consider using database transactions at the test case level when appropriate

## Performance Considerations

| Approach | Speed | Reliability | Isolation | Realism |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| SQLite (in-memory) | ⚡ Fast | Medium | High | Low |
| MySQL (transactions) | Medium | High | High | High |
| **Our Approach** | ⏳ Slower | ✅ High | Medium | ✅ High |

## When to Consider Alternatives

Consider using `RefreshDatabase` or `DatabaseTransactions` traits when:
- Test speed becomes a significant bottleneck
- Test isolation issues become unmanageable
- Running a large test suite in CI/CD pipelines

## Conclusion

Our current MySQL-based testing approach without `RefreshDatabase` provides the best balance between test reliability and real-world accuracy for our application. While it comes with some performance trade-offs, the benefits of testing against the same database engine used in production outweigh the costs for our specific use case.

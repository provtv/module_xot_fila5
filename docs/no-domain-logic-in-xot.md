# Xot must not contain domain-specific logic

**Date**: 2026-07-24

## Rule

`Modules/Xot` is the framework/base module. It provides infrastructure reused
by every other module: `XotBase*` Filament mirrors, safe-cast Actions
(`Modules/Xot/app/Actions/Cast/*`), cross-cutting traits, base providers.

It must **never** contain Actions/Models/Resources implementing logic for a
domain that already has its own dedicated module (`Modules/AI`,
`Modules/Notify`, `Modules/Media`, `Modules/Seo`, ...), regardless of where
the developer happened to be working when they wrote it.

## Why

- Breaks modular isolation — Xot becomes a heavy dependency that "knows about"
  domains it has no business knowing about.
- Makes it impossible to disable/remove a domain module without touching Xot.
- Confuses ownership — anyone looking for "AI actions" looks in
  `Modules/AI/app/Actions/`, not in `Modules/Xot/app/Actions/AI/`.

## Real cases found and fixed (2026-07-24)

- `Modules/Xot/app/Actions/AI/Ollama/{GenerateOllamaAction,ChatOllamaAction}.php`
  existed inside Xot even though `Modules/AI` already exists with its own Actions
  tree. Zero external callers referenced the Xot versions — moved to
  `Modules/AI/app/Actions/Ollama/` (namespace `Modules\AI\Actions\Ollama`).
  Details: [`Modules/AI/docs/ollama-actions-moved-from-xot.md`](../../AI/docs/ollama-actions-moved-from-xot.md).
- `Modules/Xot/app/Actions/ContextCompressorAction.php` (LLM/OpenAI text
  compression, `use OpenAI\OpenAI;`) plus a stale byte-identical duplicate
  `ContextCompressor.php` (same class name, never cleaned up when the
  properly-suffixed file was created) — moved to
  `Modules/AI/app/Actions/ContextCompressorAction.php`
  (namespace `Modules\AI\Actions`). No references anywhere in the codebase
  to either Xot copy.
- `Modules/Xot/app/Actions/Geo/GetDistanceExpressionAction.php` and
  `Modules/Xot/app/Database/Query/GeoDistanceExpression.php` — canonical
  copies already existed in `Modules/Geo/app/...`, no remaining references
  to the Xot paths. Deleted (not moved — the Geo module already owned them).

**Pattern to watch for**: a `Modules/Xot/app/Actions/<DomainName>/` subfolder
(`AI/`, `Geo/`, ...) is itself a smell — Xot's own Actions are flat or grouped
by *technical* concern (`Cast/`, `File/`, `Array/`), never by *domain* name.
If you see a domain-named subfolder under `Modules/Xot/app/Actions/`, check
whether that module already exists first.

## Checklist before adding a new Action under Modules/Xot/app/Actions/

1. Does this Action's domain already have a dedicated module
   (`Modules/AI`, `Modules/Notify`, `Modules/Media`, ...)? → it belongs there.
2. Is it generic infrastructure reusable across modules with no domain logic
   (safe casts, `XotBase*`, cross-cutting helpers)? → Xot is correct.
3. When unsure, check whether the target domain module already has a
   matching `Actions/<Subfolder>/` — if so, the answer is almost always
   "put it there".

# ST-XX: RelationX Trait Analysis and Documentation

## As a Project Developer
I need to fully understand the RelationX trait
So that I can correctly implement cross-database relationships in models

## Context
The RelationX trait in Modules/Xot/app/Models/Traits/RelationX.php provides
extended Eloquent relationship methods that handle cross-database pivot tables.
This study is required to document its conventions and prevent bugs in modules
that rely on multi-database configurations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Trace the full execution path of `belongsToManyX` and `morphToManyX`
- [ ] Identify pivot class guessing algorithm and fallback chain
- [ ] Document database name comparison logic
- [ ] Identify SQLite compatibility handling
- [ ] Document in Modules/Xot/docs/relationx-analysis.md

# Autonomous Priority Rule

**Date**: 2025-12-18
**Context**: "Super Mucca" Mode

## The Rule
The AI Assistant **MUST ALWAYS** determine the order and priority of actions. This is a fundamental operational rule derived from the project's core philosophy of "Logica, Religione, Politica, Zen".

## Why?
To ensure efficiency, adherence to architectural standards (Laraxot, DRY, KISS, SOLID), and prevents "rabbit holes". The AI has the context of the entire project and quality gates (PHPStan L10) that individual requests might overlook. This rule aligns with the project's "Super Mucca" methodology of maximum confidence and deep analysis.

## Application
1.  **Evaluate Request**: Understand the user's intent with maximum confidence and thorough analysis.
2.  **Assess Impact**: Check against Project Rules (Docs, Architecture, Tech Stack, Quality Gates).
3.  **Determine Priority** following the hierarchy:
    *   **CRITICAL**: Compliance (PHPStan L10, Linters), Security, Core Architecture integrity, DRY violations.
    *   **HIGH**: Documentation updates (especially docs/ folders), Functional requirements, Type safety improvements.
    *   **MEDIUM**: Refactoring, Code optimization, Performance improvements.
    *   **LOW**: Cosmetic changes, Styling updates (unless part of a "Wows" design requirement).
4.  **Execute**: Proceed based on *your* determined priority, informing the user if it deviates from their implicit order.
5.  **Verify**: Ensure all changes maintain project quality standards (PHPStan, PHPMD, PHP Insights).

## Integration with Project Philosophy
This rule connects directly with the project's core principles:
- **Logica**: Logical decision-making based on project context
- **Religione**: Following architectural rules (XotBase, no direct Filament extensions)
- **Politica**: Governance of development processes
- **Zen**: Flow state of autonomous decision-making

## Commandment
"Ordine e priorita le scegli sempre te." (Order and priority are always chosen by you.)

This rule ensures the AI operates with the autonomy needed to maintain project quality while following the Super Mucca methodology of deep analysis and maximum confidence.

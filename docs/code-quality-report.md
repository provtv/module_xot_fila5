## Stato architetturale

- Nessuna violazione `extends \Filament\...` diretto rilevata (regola XotBase rispettata).

## Azioni consigliate

- Triage dei 9 file con TODO/FIXME aperti.
- Convertire le 57 Action con Facade dirette al pattern QueueableAction (niente facade nella cartella Actions).
- Rifattorizzare i metodi/classi elencati sopra (complessità ciclomatica/NPath oltre soglia).

## Come migliorare — modifiche effettive da fare

### 1. Rimuovere le Facade da `app/Actions/`

Regola del progetto (skill `queueable-action-trait`): nelle Action **niente Facade**, le dipendenze si iniettano nel costruttore — il container le risolve automaticamente quando l'Action viene chiamata con `app(XxxAction::class)->execute(...)`.

Facade usate in questo modulo e relativa dipendenza da iniettare al loro posto:

| Facade | Inietta invece |
|---|---|
| `App::` | `Illuminate\Contracts\Foundation\Application` |
| `Artisan::` | `Illuminate\Contracts\Console\Kernel` |
| `Auth::` | `Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Factory` |
| `Cache::` | `Illuminate\Contracts\Cache\Repository` |
| `Config::` | `Illuminate\Contracts\Config\Repository` |
| `DB::` | `Illuminate\Database\ConnectionInterface` |
| `Event::` | `Illuminate\Contracts\Events\Dispatcher` |
| `File::` | `Illuminate\Filesystem\Filesystem` |
| `Http::` | `Illuminate\Http\Client\Factory` |
| `Log::` | `Psr\Log\LoggerInterface` |
| `Module::` | `Nwidart\Modules\Contracts\RepositoryInterface` |
| `Route::` | `Illuminate\Routing\UrlGenerator` |
| `Schema::` | `Illuminate\Database\ConnectionInterface (poi ->getSchemaBuilder())` |
| `Session::` | `Illuminate\Contracts\Session\Session` |
| `Storage::` | `Illuminate\Contracts\Filesystem\Factory` |
| `Validator::` | `Illuminate\Contracts\Validation\Factory` |
| `View::` | `Illuminate\Contracts\View\Factory` |

**Esempio concreto** — `Modules/Xot/app/Actions/Module/GetModuleConfigAction.php`:

```php
// PRIMA
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;

class XxxAction
{
    use QueueableAction;

    public function execute(string $arg): mixed
    {
        $response = Http::get($url);
        // ...
    }
}

// DOPO
use Illuminate\Http\Client\Factory as HttpFactory;

class XxxAction
{
    use QueueableAction;

    public function __construct(private readonly HttpFactory $http)
    {
    }

    public function execute(string $arg): mixed
    {
        $response = $this->http->get($url);
        // ...
    }
}
```

Vantaggio pratico: l'Action diventa testabile senza `Http::fake()` globale — nei test Pest si passa un mock/fake del client via `app()->instance(HttpFactory::class, $fakeClient)` o via binding nel service provider di test.

File da convertire in questo modulo (elenco sopra in "Numeri"), uno alla volta, con `php -l` + PHPStan L max sul singolo file dopo ogni modifica.

Tecnica di refactoring consigliata: **estrarre ogni ramo condizionale in un metodo privato dedicato**, o sostituire lunghe catene if/elseif con una `match()` che delega a metodi/Action più piccoli. Esempio:

```php
// PRIMA — un metodo con 15+ rami
public function resolveType(string $type): string
{
    if ($type === "a") { /* ... */ }
    elseif ($type === "b") { /* ... */ }
    // ... altri 10+ rami
}

// DOPO — dispatch table, ogni ramo è un metodo testabile singolarmente
public function resolveType(string $type): string
{
    return match ($type) {
        "a" => $this->resolveA(),
        "b" => $this->resolveB(),
        default => throw new \InvalidArgumentException("Unknown type: {$type}"),
    };
}
```

Ogni `resolveX()` estratto scende sotto soglia 10 e diventa testabile in isolamento con un test Pest dedicato.

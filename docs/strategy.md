# Product Strategy: Xot Core

## 🌍 Market Context
Internal framework strategy to maintain a clean, scalable modular monolith architecture while preparing for future microservices migration.

## ⚔️ Competitive Landscape
- **Standard Laravel:** Flexible but lacks enforced modular standards.
- **Nwidart/Laravel-Modules:** Good foundation, but Xot adds the "Super Mucca" architectural layer (XotBase).

## 💎 Unique Value Proposition
A "Contract-First" framework where the base classes define the standard for all specialized modules.

## 🏛️ Strategic Pillars
1. **Architectural Purity:** Strictly follow XotBase patterns.
2. **Performance First:** Minimal abstraction overhead.
3. **AI-First Design:** Code structure optimized for LLM comprehension.

## 👥 Target Personas
- **Framework Architect:** Needs to maintain long-term scalability.
- **Module Contributor:** Needs clear rules on how to build compliant modules.

## 🗺️ Strategic Roadmap (1-2 Years)
Transition into a package-agnostic core that can support multiple frontend frameworks (Filament, Inertia, Livewire) through specialized adapters.
